As Social Leader of my MSc cohort, I wanted to plan a 6 week lunch networking schedule. I could generate random groups each week, but I wanted to minimize repeat meetings
to maximize the number of distinct people each student meets.

To do this, I created classes for student and lunch group that could keep track of who had met whom thus far.

In the end, I am able to do much better than the purely random strategy.
